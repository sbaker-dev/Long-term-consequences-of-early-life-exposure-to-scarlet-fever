## Introduction

The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis suggests that adverse early life circumstances can have long-lasting, irreversible effects on one’s health and well-being in older age. Several childhood diseases from the bacterium streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), which causes a wide range of diseases such as strep pharyngitis, scarlet fever, or acute rheumatic fever (ARF)^[@Ferretti2016]^, have previously been linked to DOHaD. Even singular episodes of ARF can cause rheumatic heart disease (RHD)^[@Sika-Paotonu2016]^. Between 35-72% of children who develop RHD do so after experiencing carditis, the inflammation of one of the hearts cardiums^[@Nizet2018]^, which usually requires hospitalisation for several weeks^[@Sika-Paotonu2016]^. However, even without hospitalisation 35% of children who experienced ARF developed RHD within a year, and 61% developed RHD within 10 years^[@Sika-Paotonu2016]^. Given ARF can be caused from untreated strep pharyngitis, which causes 20%-40% of all outpatient medical visits amongst children^[@Wessels2016]^, an untreated early life infection of S. pyogenes can have life long and irreversible effects on individuals’ health.

The variation in outcomes of infection is likely linked to the known heterogeneous nature of S. pyogenes's duration^[@Johnson2010]^, the anti-body response^[@Johnson2010]^, and host immune response^[@Sarkar2017],[@Sela2018]^. Many elevations of S. pyogenes anti-bodies have been linked to increased risk of later life disease such as Crohns disease^[@Bermont2020]^, narcolepsy^[@Aran2009]^, henoch-schoenlein purural^[@Health1999a]^, and psoriasis^[@Telfer1992]^. Many outcomes also have further commodities, with RHD increasing the risk of ischemic stroke 17 fold^[@Ahmad2016]^. Recently, S. pyogenes was found to affect paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), which is characterised by extreme anxiety, behaviour regression, depression, suicidally, and general reductions in quality of life and educational attainment^[@Orefici2016]^. S. pyogenes anti-bodies was found elevated in 60% PANDAS patients^[@Chain2020]^. Even in PANDAS patients not actively colonized with S. pyogenes, evidence was found to suggest that these elevated auto anti-bodies caused neuro-inflammation^[@Chain2020]^.

Investigating the long term effects of S. pyogenes is challenging, as one the most common outcomes of strep pharyngitis is not a notifiable diseases. Scarlet fever is less common but is a notifiable diseases, characterised by a rash in combination with another S. pyogenes infections which is most commonly strep pharyngitis^[@Wessels2016]^. Prior research on scarlet fever in relation to DOHaD found links to increased later life cardiovascular disease^[@Quaranta2013]^ and, when combined with other childhood infections, noneffective psychosis in men^[@Khandaker2018]^. Educational attainment has also been investigated and was not found to be reduced based on 11-year old's examinations^[@McKeown1976]^. Given known relationships between scarlet fever and strep pharyngitis, we assume that it will vary in line with the underlying unobserved strep pharyngitis rates and ultimately the prevalence of S. pyogenes. To further this research, we investigated the association between exposure to scarlet fever in one’s district of birth, heart disease in later life, and two indicators of neurodevelopment: educational attainment and cognition.
