## Abstract

### Background
Exposure to Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) in childhood, which causes, amongst others, strep throat and scarlet fever, has previously been shown to increase the risk of heart disease and acute rheumatic fever. Rates of scarlet fever have recently risen to the highest levels in the UK since the 1960s, yet few studies have been dedicated to investigating the potential long-term effects using scarlet fever rates. 
 
### Methods
We linked birth locations from UK Biobank participants to regional data on weekly disease notifications of 
scarlet fever from the Registrar-Generalâ€™s Weekly Returns. We calculated the average incidence of scarlet fever at the ages of one, five, and ten years old. We estimated the associations of early life exposure to scarlet fever and later life cardiovascular health, fluid intelligence and educational attainment.

### Results
We analysed 241 685 individuals born between 1946 and 1971 who were sampled by the UK Biobank.
An additional case of scarlet fever per 100 population in the district of birth by the age of 10 was associated with 7.25 additional 
cases of ischemic heart disease per 100 individuals.

### Conclusions
Participants who experienced higher incidence of scarlet fever in early childhood had higher risk of ischemic heart 
disease later in life.

### Key Messages

* Incidence of scarlet fever in childhood associates with later life ischemic heart disease
* Recent rises in scarlet fever seen in the UK may have long term repercussions
