## Results

Table 1 reports the characteristics of our cohort that pass our sample selection criteria. We defined heart disease from ICD9 and ICD10 codes^[@Carter2019]^ (See supplementary information). Given the S. pyogenes effects multiple levels of the heart^[@Nizet2018]^, we investigated the association of scarlet fever with multiple sub-categories of heart disease. We included RHD as a positive control, as we know these individuals will have been infected as RHD is a known complication of untreated infections via developed into ARF. Given that ARF and RHD damage often is valvular, mostly involving the mitral valve^[@Sika-Paotonu2016]^, we also include vascular disease.

Reporting of vascular disease is rare in our sample, but damage from infection may not be sufficient to be diagnosed. Since other forms of heart disease can be caused from underlying reductions in blood flow or damage to the heart valves, we also investigate broader definitions of heart disease, such as ischemic heart disease (IHD)^[@Jensen2020]^ and acute myocardial infarction (AMI)^[@Saleh2018]^. Full mitral stenosis increases the risk of ischemic stroke 17-fold^[@Ahmad2016]^, so any damage done to the mitral valve may increase the risk of stroke. We also include the broadest definition of cardiovascular disease of CVD, which has previously been investigated in relation to scarlet fever^[@Quaranta2013]^.
 
Fluid intelligence is standardised, with an mean score of 0 and standard deviation of 1, of individuals correct responses to 13 questions administered by the UK Biobank. We use years of education as defined elsewhere^[@Lee2018a]^, ranging between 10 and 20 years which is then standardised to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. The average regional incidence rate of scarlet fever declines over the study period (Figure 1). The mean exposure for the disease is low, at a rate of 0.09 cases per 100 individuals on average in the district of birth by the age of ten. The variance in incidence rates is lower for definitions that span longer periods due to reducing the impact of individual year exposures from potential outbreaks or abnormal years.

Risk difference results for heart diseases are shown in Figure 3. Results are interpreted as additional case of scarlet fever each year on average per 100 individuals by the age of one, five or ten meaning an individual would experience an additional one, five, or ten cases respectively. Using AMI as an example, an additional case of scarlet fever each year on average per 100 individuals by age 5 was associated with an additional 3.24 cases of AMI per 100 individuals (95%CI: -0.90; 1.11); which can also be interpreted as a 3.24 percentage point increase in AMI, which we refer to as the risk difference (RD). 

There was little evidence that average regional incidence rates of scarlet fever were associated with rheumatic disease by age one (RD=0.05, 95%CI: -0.36; 0.46), age five (RD=0.15, 95%CI: -0.78; 1.08), or by the age of ten (RD=-0.12, 95%CI: -1.53; 1.30). Vascular disease also presented limited evidence of association to average regional incidence rates of scarlet fever by age one (RD=-0.18, 95%CI: -0.72; 0.36), age five (RD=-0.77, 95%CI: -2.21; 0.66), or by the age of ten (RD-1.70, 95%CI: -3.38; 1.06). Weak evidence exists for an association of AMI and average regional incidence rates of scarlet fever by the age of one (RD=051, 95%CI: -0.31; 1.33), five (RD=1.59, 95%CI: -0.23; 3.42) and ten (RD=3.24, 95%CI: 0.31; 6.17); but only by the age of ten do the CIs not include zero. 

Positive associations are found between IHD and additional case of scarlet fever each year on average per 100 individuals by the age one (RD=0.76, 95%CI: -0.53; 2.04), five (RD=2.62, 95%CI: -0.64; 5.87), and ten (RD=7.25, 95%CI: 1.58; 12.92) although the CIs are wide and only by age ten do they not include zero. We also found evidence of scarlet exposure on increasing stroke, with the strength of this relationship the strongest by age of five (RD=1.93, 95%CI: -0.19; 4.04) but a positive association also being found by age one (RD=0.64, 95%CI: -0.13; 1.41) and by age ten (RD=2.39, 95%CI: -0.96; 5.73). There is little evidence for the association between CVD and regional incidence rates of scarlet fever by age one (RD=-0.54, 95%CI:-3.22; 2.14), by age five (RD=0.77, 95%CI: -5.32; 6.86), or by age ten (RD=-1.11, 95%CI: -10.98; 8.77).

Standard deviation change associations for educational attainment and fluid intelligence are shown in figure 4. We found little evidence that an additional case of scarlet fever each year on average by age one (0.03, 95%CI: -0.03; 0.10), by age five (0.02, 95%CI: -0.12; 0.16) or by age ten (0.10, 95%CI: -0.13; 0.32) was associated with education attainment.  We did find evidence that each additional case of scarlet fever per 100 individuals by age one was associated with a 0.13 (95%CI: -0.23; -0.04) standard deviation lower score on the fluid intelligence tests. The point estimates remain negative and roughly unchanged as we investigate exposure by the age of five (-0.16, 95%CI -0.39; 0.08) and the age of ten (-0.17, 95%CI: -0.54; 0.19) but the standard errors increased.
